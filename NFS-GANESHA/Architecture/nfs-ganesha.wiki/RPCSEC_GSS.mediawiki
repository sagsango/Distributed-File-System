== Using RPCSEC_GSS with NFS-GANESHA == 

NFS-GANESHA supports RPCSEC_GSS with krb5 authentication. It use the libgssrpc library provided with the krb5 distribution. For having a clean distribution of this library you must install krb5-1.6 at least.

Enabling RPCSEC_GSS support is done at "./configure" time. You should use something like
<pre>
# ./configure --with-fsal=<desired FSAL>  --enable-gssrpc
</pre>

Configuration follows several steps:
***Your client is to be configured as if it would mount a linux kernel nfs server. You have to set up the kernel modules, the keytabs, the rpc.gssd and rpc.ipmapd must be running
***In the configuration file for NFS-GANESHA you may need to have the following block if deviating from defaults
<pre>
NFS_KRB5
{
   PrincipalName = nfs@<yourhost> ;
   KeytabPath = /etc/krb5.keytab ;
   Active_krb5 = YES ;
}
</pre>  

The principal name should contain the nfs server hostname, the keytab must contain slots related to <nowiki>nfs/<nfs server hostname></nowiki>
***No rpc.gssd or rpc.svcgssd or rpc.ipmad is required on the host running NFS-GANESHA, it does what these daemons do internally
***Perform your mount command
<pre>
# mount -t nfs4 -o sec=krb5 <nfs-ganesha server>:<path> /mnt
# mount -t nfs4 -o sec=krb5i <nfs-ganesha server>:<path> /mnt
# mount -t nfs4 -o sec=krb5p <nfs-ganesha server>:<path> /mnt
</pre>

Remember: when a user traverse a kerberized mount point, it must have a valid kerberos ticket (basically, he used kinit to generate it), otherwise he will receive a EPERM error.
