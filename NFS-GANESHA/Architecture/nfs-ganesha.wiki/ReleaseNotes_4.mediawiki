== Features ==
* POSIX ACL support for FSAL_CEPH
* Enhancements to Export Update (DBUS) and Reload (SIGHUP)
** protocol update (add/remove v3/v4 to export)
** Pseudo Path can be changed when reloading exports
** Refresh file system table (allows adding exports for new file systems)
* FSAL_PROXY_V3
* NFSACL POSIX ACL side-band protocol for NFSv3
* Add xattr to FSAL_CEPH
* Add xattr to FSAL_RGW
* Match xattr support up with RFC 8276
* FSAL_CEPH enhancement to release inodes quicker
* Option to increase aggressiveness of MDCACHE releasing entries
* Can actually disable RQUOTA and NFSv3 when building
* Improvements to building on MacOS and other compilers
* FSAL_KVSFS
* Support BTRFS subvolumes as if they are separate file systems

== Configuration ==
* Export as noted above
* Minimum SVC worker threads is configurable
* Option to allow UDP for MOUNT only
* Add configurable RecoveryRoot, RecoveryDir, RecoveryOldDir
* Maximum number of clientids configurable

== Logging and Information ==
* Log POSIX file system type
* dbus query of mdcache utilization
* dbus stats formatting changes to improve clarity
* reduction log level for some noisy log messages
* 4.1 and 4.2 operation stats
* Additional debug and info logging for exports
* No longer look to environment for log levels (too many ways to change log levels...)
* No longer manipulate log level with SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 (too many ways to change log levels...)
* Default_Log_Level is now useful
* Removal of a component (including ALL) from LOG { COMPONENTS {}} will properly revert on SIGHUP (this MAY revert changes done with dbus - don't mix dbus and SIGHUP...)
* Logging documentation improved
* Export config documentation improved
* Option to display log timestamps in UTC
* Info logging of socket binding


== Areas of Fixes ==
* Stats
* Handle sizes and issues, particularly for FSAL_CEPH
* Memory leaks
* Error returns
* Segfaults
* MDCACHE (readdir, export root LRU management)
* SELinux
* Skip various non-exportable POSIX file system types
* build and packaging fixes
* total audit of export and other resource usage in op context and assure that op_ctx is set everywhere
* state_lock usage fixups
* Always provide wcc attributes for NFSv3
* NFSv4.1 close/lock race fix and other lock fixes
* Correct handling of errors during export config processing
* Fix up EPERM vs EACCESS confusion
* Block MOUNT if client won't have access to export
* Integer size corrections in log messages
* NFSv3 READDIR response size fixes (allows more entries AND fixes CVE-2018-17159)
* Another CVE-2018-17159 fix is to cap NFS v4.0 max response size
* Various creds fixes in FSAL_CEPH
* Fix EXCLUSIVE create
* Fix issues of caller_name in NLM, proper handling of IPv4/IPv6 and when to use caller name vs. IP address
* improved handling of duplicates of in progress requests
