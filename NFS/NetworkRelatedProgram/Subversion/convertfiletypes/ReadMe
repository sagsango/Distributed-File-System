The convertsvn program is for use in converting repositories using ,xyz
filename extension to using properties for holding filetype information.

Please read the filetypes section in the main subversion ReadMe before
using this program.

Ensure that all working copies associated with this repository have no
local modifications. Then move the working copy out of the way - it
will no longer be used.

*unset svn$filetypeext
Check out a new working copy.
*convertsvn > convert
This will create a script called convert that contains subversion
commands to set appropriate filetype properties and rename files.
*obey convert
*svn ci -m "Change filetypes to properties"

That's it. Old working copies will still work if you set the
svn$filetypeext variable, but if you try to updating them to a later
version then it will probably fail to update properly.

The above only converts the latest revision of the repository, for the file checked out in the working copy. If you want to convert a repository's entire history, so that older revisions also have the filetype information then you can use the ro-filetype.pl script. See the comments on the top of the script for how to use it.
