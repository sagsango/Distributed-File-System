HTML2SH and StrongCopy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HTML2SH is a perl script to convert HTML pages to StrongHelp format.
StrongCopy copies a directory of files into a StrongHelp file.
Both are command line programs which will run either on RISC OS
or GNU/Linux, and possibly other operating systems
(although currently only on little-endian processors).

What it can convert:
Simple tags like <B>,<I>,<EM>,<PRE>,<H1> etc.
Links between pages and within that same page
Lists
Alignment
Named characters
Images (Currently it just uses the ALT text)

What it can't do:
Frames
Tables
Image maps
Forms
Broken HTML
Javascript
The cooking
The washing up
Any other fancy stuff

Sometimes it does not get the layout perfect, but it is usually readable.
It is most suitable for converting technical manuals and documentation,
for example the PHP manual.


Using it
~~~~~~~~
Set the Current Selected Directory to the directory containing the HTML
*HTML2SH [filetoconvert]
It will then convert the specified file, and any files linked to from the file.
(if the filename is ommitted then it defaults to index.html)
The files will be save in a directory named temp which is created in the
currently selected directory.
To create the StrongHelp manual from these converted files,
*strongcopy [-v] [-o outputfile] [inputdir]
-v (verbose) prints the name of each file as it is added
output file is the name of the output stronghelp manual
(if ommited, it defaults to Manual)
inputdir is the directory containing the files to be copied
(if ommitted, it defaults to the current directory)
You should ensure that the wimpslot is set larger than the largest file to convert.
