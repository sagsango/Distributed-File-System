Wiresalmon
~~~~~~~~~~

Wiresalmon is a network packet sniffer, which can be used to capture
packets transmitted and recieved on a network. Captured packets are
saved to a file in libpcap format, which can be read by protocol
analysers on other platforms, such as Wireshark.
Wiresalmon does not itself provide any means of viewing the captured
data.

Using
-----

Doubleclick !Wiresalmon to load the application and module. Click Select
on the iconbar icon to open the capture control window.
Drag the file icon to a directory, or enter a filename, to specify
where the captured data should be saved. Note that you should not save
directly to a network filesystem, because every time data is saved it
would create more network traffic which would then be captured and saved
creating yet more traffic.

Click Select on the start capture button to start captuting packets.

When you wish to stop capturing, click Select on the stop capture
button.


Compatibility
-------------

Wiresalmon should work with any network card that provides a standard
DCI4 driver. It has been tested with EtherK on an Iyonix and EtherX on a
RiscPC with a Simtec Net100 NIC.


Limitations
-----------

When the Wiresalmon module is loaded or killed, it must reinitialise
all the DCI4 drivers in order to insert or remove its hooks into the
drivers. It is possible that some drivers may not cope very well with
this, e.g. a ppp driver may drop its connection.

Recieved packets are only captured if they are passed from the DCI4
driver to a higher level protocol module. If no protocol module has
registered an interest in the packet type, then Wiresalmon will not
capture the packet. If the network hardware filters out packets then
these packets will not be seen by Wiresalmon.
