hmail

hmail is a simple command line program to send email to an SMTP
smarthost. It is intended mainly for use with other programs, such as
PHP, that want something with an interface like sendmail on Unix.

Setting up
----------
Ensure the !hamil application is somewhere where it is seen before use.
From the command line, run hmail once with details of the smtp server
to use. This setting will be saved in your choices directory.
*hmail --server smtp.example.com
or, if the server uses a non-standard port:
*hmail --server smtp.example.com:26


Using
-----
hmail will read an email from stdin, and forward it on to the
configured smtp server. The format of the mail should conform to RFC
822, and include all relevant header lines, and all line should be CRLF
terminated. hmail will search the input message for To: and From:
headers to use.
If there is any kind of error while sending, the error message will
be sent to syslog, and the email will not have been sent. The email
is not saved or retried, it is up to the caller to do so if needed.


Using with PHP
------------
To use the mail() function in PHP, edit your php.ini file so that
sendmail_path = hmail
This may become the default in future PHP versions, and so may become
unnecessary.


Limitations
-----------

Sending an email to multiple recipients is not currently supported.
