1. NFS Ganesha is in user space, unlike traditional NFS which uses Kernal space.
2. Ganesha is heighly scalable, and easy to develop, trobuleshoot, esaly compatible
  for many protocal like : SBM, gluster etc.
3. NFS Ganesha is uses active-active server for high aviability.
   means all the server will be on and if some server dies then its verual ip will be 
   transfered to other server, and client will get their requests without any issues.
4. We use heartbeat to check aviability of each node.
5. stateless server.







   Grace Period:
    One of the node goes down, then all other nodes in cluser are send a dbus signal 
  with the id of node which goes down, then all the requests comming to the died 
  node will be redirected to other nodes, but to recover the state for the clinet,
  means holding locks etc, It take some time. During this time no io is possble.
  This is known as grace period. I which all the node in the cluser participate.
